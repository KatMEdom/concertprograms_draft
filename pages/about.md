## About the Collection

This collection is comprised of eighteen concert programs and two posters for concerts on which one or more of my pieces were performed.  Seventeen of these programs and the two posters were digitized from my personal collection.  All of these concerts, two of which were degree recitals, occured while earning my composition degrees at Sacramento State University and University of Oregon.  Admittedly, several concerts during the second half of my master's degree at University of Oregon are not represented in this collection.  Because of the on-set of the COVID-19 pandemic, these concerts were given virtually, and I never recieved programs.  However, all of the pieces performed on these concerts are represented in the program for my Graduate Recital, the only born-digital program in the collection.  Recordings for the majority of the pieces represented in these programs are also available on my YouTube channel.

## About the Composer

Kathryn Edom is a percussionist, composer, and aspiring music librarian originally from Elk Grove, California.  She earned her BM in Music Theory and Composition from Sacramento State University and her MM in Music Composition from University of Oregon before moving to Bloomington to pursue a Master's in Library Sciences at Indiana University.  Over the course of her composition career she has written for a wide variety of instruments and ensembles and is currently working on a five-movement work for wind ensemble.  During her time at Sacramento State, she had the privilege of studying Balinese gamelan, North Indian tabla, and a variety of other hand drums with percussionist Dan Kennedy, which has heavily influenced her compositions and writing style.
